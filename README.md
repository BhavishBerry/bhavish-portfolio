## 👋 About Me

I'm an AI/ML Engineer currently pursuing a B.Tech with a Minor in AI (IIT). I focus on building intelligent backend systems and applied ML pipelines rather than UI-heavy applications.

**Core Focus Areas:**
- 🧠 LLM & RAG Systems — Document-grounded AI, prompt engineering
- 🤖 Machine Learning — Vision, audio, NLP, time-series models
- ⚙️ AI Backend Systems — Python pipelines, AI orchestration
